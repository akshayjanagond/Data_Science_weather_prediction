# Data_Science_weather_prediction 
**Project Description**:
Youâ€™re a data scientist in a company that provides energy to its clients. In the current climate of soaring energy prices, the company wants to offer a new service by which local clients that are near a source of renewable energy will have free energy when there is a surplus of energy in that area. The company wants to roll out a pilot project in which they test this scheme with a subset of customers in January 2025. As a first step, however, the company needs to have a system that can reliably predict, at least 36 hours in advance, whether there will be a surplus of solar energy so that they can send out an alert to the customers in the area to allow them to opt-in to the slot.



# Solar Energy Surplus Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting solar energy surplus using advanced RNN-based machine learning techniques. It provides 36-hour-ahead predictions for surplus energy to help optimize energy distribution in pilot programs like the one in Colchester. The forecast aims to identify surplus periods, enabling energy providers to offer surplus energy for free, improving energy efficiency and promoting sustainable usage.

## Installation and Usage Instructions

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment
On Windows:

   python -m venv venv

On macOS:

   python3 -m venv venv

**Activate the Virtual Environment**
On Windows:

   venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS:

   source venv/bin/activate

You will see (venv) before your terminal prompt if the environment is activated.

## 2. Install Required Libraries

Run the following command in your terminal:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
